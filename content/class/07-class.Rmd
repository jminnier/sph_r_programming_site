## R Project files

Last class we finished up part5 materials. This is class 7, and we will start with part6 now (sorry, we're going to be off by one from now on). Please download the part6 sub-folder from [this dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/q4z72523kl84ywp/AAASb1YIFRpxzrjOeq1FVcXua?dl=0). Be sure to unzip if necessary. Knit the `part6.Rmd` to install any required packages.

This section is mainly a practice, with some additional ggplot lessons. There will be lots of time for breakout room challenges so that you can get practice working on these data wrangling and graphing problems together.


## Class Video

The video will be uploaded after class.

### Post-Class

Please fill out the following survey and we will discuss the results during the next lecture. All responses will be anonymous.

- Clearest Point: What was the most clear part of the lecture?
- Muddiest Point: What was the most unclear part of the lecture to you?
- Anything Else: Is there something you'd like me to know?

## Muddiest Points/Clearest Points 

I will add the muddiest/clearest points from the survey after the first class.

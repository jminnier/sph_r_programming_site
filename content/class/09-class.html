<h3>Post-Class</h3>
<p>Please fill out the following survey and we will discuss the results during the next lecture. All responses will be anonymous.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clearest Point: What was the most clear part of the lecture?</li>
<li>Muddiest Point: What was the most unclear part of the lecture to you?</li>
<li>Anything Else: Is there something you’d like me to know?</li>

<h2>Muddiest Points</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The concept of clustering is still a bit muddy for me.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>PCA the graph showing contributions from each variable section was muddy for me.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Still struggling to understand what a principal component analysis is</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To be honest, I wasn’t really at 100% for this lecture and I wasn’t able to follow what was going on that well, but I plan to review this on my own.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Clustering</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>still feeling a little confused on PCA. Will be rewatching the videos on the site.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Clustering</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Pca</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Still trying to wrap my head around PCA/clustering. The homework will help.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A lot of this was muddy. This jumped pretty far ahead of what we’ve learned in our other classes. It’s hard for me to understand the code when I don’t know the math and whatnot behind it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Points taken. Hope the videos helped.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What we’re doing for our final project/what our options are for models</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will talk about this in class.</p>

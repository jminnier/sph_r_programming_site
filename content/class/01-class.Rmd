# Install R/Rstudio

Before class, please install R and Rstudio. If it has been a while since you installed R, please re-install R to update to the most recent version (warning: you may lose all your installed packages and will have to reinstall them).

Installation instructions can be found [here.](https://jminnier-berd-r-courses.netlify.app/00-install-instruct.html)

Please also [download the "part1" folder in this course materials link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/q4z72523kl84ywp/AAASb1YIFRpxzrjOeq1FVcXua?dl=0). Unzip the folder if needed. Open the Rstudio project by double clicking on the .Rproj file ("Rstudio project file"). Run the `00-install-packages.R` script to install necessary packages. A video on how to do this can be found [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU22sKHn9uc)

# Class files

## R Project files

Before each class, I will update [this folder link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/q4z72523kl84ywp/AAASb1YIFRpxzrjOeq1FVcXua?dl=0) with the appropriate "part" folder. Please download the `part1` folder. Unzip this folder and open in Rstudio by double clicking on the .Rproj file. This folder will have the files for this part and the assignment.

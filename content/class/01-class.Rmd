# Class files

## R Project files

Before each class, I will load an R project on github, and provide the download link. Unzip this folder and open in Rstudio by double clicking on the .Rproj file. This folder will have the files for this part and the assignment.

## Slides

Open the class introduction slides in a separate window: <a href="https://sph-r-programming-2022.netlify.app/slides/01-introduction_slides#1" target="_blank">https://sph-r-programming-2022.netlify.app/01-introduction_slides#1</a>

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_url('https://sph-r-programming-2022.netlify.com/slides/01-introduction_slides#1')

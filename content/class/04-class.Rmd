## Midterm will be assigned next week

For this week, identify 1 dataset from the `tidytuesday` datasets and identify a research question that you think can be answered by the data. Be curious!

Your dataset should have:

- categorical variables
- continuous variables

https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday

We will take part of next class doing short meetings to discuss the midterm and the datasets individually.

### Post-Class

Please fill out the following survey and we will discuss the results during the next lecture. All responses will be anonymous.

- Clearest Point: What was the most clear part of the lecture?
- Muddiest Point: What was the most unclear part of the lecture to you?
- Anything Else: Is there something you'd like me to know?

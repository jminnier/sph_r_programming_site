## R Project files

Before each class, I will update [this folder link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/q4z72523kl84ywp/AAASb1YIFRpxzrjOeq1FVcXua?dl=0) with the appropriate "part" folder. Please download this sub-folder for class materials. Be sure to unzip if necessary.


## Class Video

The video will be uploaded after class.

### Post-Class

Please fill out the following survey and we will discuss the results during the next lecture. All responses will be anonymous.

- Clearest Point: What was the most clear part of the lecture?
- Muddiest Point: What was the most unclear part of the lecture to you?
- Anything Else: Is there something you'd like me to know?

## Muddiest Points/Clearest Points 

I will add the muddiest/clearest points from the survey after the first class.

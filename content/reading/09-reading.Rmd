For learning more about statistics with R:

- Modern Dive / Statistical Inference via Data Science by Chester Ismay and Albert Y Kim is a nice place to start: <https://moderndive.com/>
- Danielle Navarro's Learning Statistics with R is excellent and talks much more about statistics: <https://learningstatisticswithr.com/>
- [Model Basics](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/model-basics.html) from R for Data Science

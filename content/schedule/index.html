<p>Hereâ€™s your roadmap for the quarter!</p>
<ul>
<li><i class="fas fa-book-reader"></i> Readings are supplemental to each lecture session</li>
<li><i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i> Assignments are due by <strong>11:59 PM</strong> on the day they are due</li>
<li><i class="fas fa-chalkboard-teacher"></i> Class materials (slides, in-class activities, etc.) will be added on the day of class</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that this schedule is tentative. I want us to learn concepts, rather than have a lot of material.</p>

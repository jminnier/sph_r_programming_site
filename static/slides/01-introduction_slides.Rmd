# Letting me Know

When we're doing the activity, use the hands up in Zoom to indicate that you're finished.

If you have questions, please ask them in chat.

---
# Let's Try Out Chat

Open the chat window (if we are in full screen, press the escape key, and then click on the chat icon)

<img src="image/week1/zoom_chat.jpg" width = 800>

Type in Chat:

- Your Name
- Your Year
- What you hope to learn from this course

---
# 5 minute meeting

Please schedule a time here: 

It helps me to understand why you're in the course and what you want to learn


---
# Rules for Interaction

During Class

- Post questions in Chat
    - Eric will interrupt me to make sure these questions are answered
- Post answers to questions in chat if you know them
- You can unmute as well

---
# Rules for Interaction

During Class

- Work with your buddy if we're working on a lab 
- Share screens to talk about issues

---
# Sharing Your Screen

# Function of the Week

- Learn and share about an underrated `tidyverse()` function
- Pick a week to present here: 
- Share your experience with the function
  - Is it useful?
  - Is it hard to use?
  - Share an example
- You will have time to meet with me befor you present
  
---
# Midterm / Final Project

- Midterm: Pick a dataset and show that you can explore it, plot it, and transform it to answer a specific question
  - Schedule a meeting to discuss the data
- Final: Pick a different dataset and build a model using machine learning or statistics
  - 
---
# Let's try the Breakout Rooms

- Let's try it (3 minutes)
- Icebreaker: What is your favorite all purpose condiment (such as salsa, ketchup, or chile oil?) and why?

---
# Zoom Recordings/Attendance

- I will record each session and Eric will post it as soon it is ready
- I will pause recording for breakout rooms (that won't be recorded)

# Learning Objectives

By the end of this course you will be able to:

1. **Understand** and **utilize** **R/RStudio**.
2. **Understand** basic data types and data structures in R.
3. **Familiarize** and **load** data files (Excel, Comma Separated Value files) into R/Rstudio, with tips on formatting.
4. **Visualize** datasets using **ggplot2** and understand how to build basic plots using **ggplot2** syntax.
5. **Filter** and **format** data in R for use with various routines.
6. **Execute** and **Interpret** some basic statistics in R.
7. **Automate** repetitive tasks in R, such as loading a folder of files.
8. **Execute** basic machine learning workflows using `tidymodels`.
9. **Your Choice**: `shiny`, `leaflet` or `tidytext`.

# Caveat Emptor

- This is *not* a conventional programming course
- We try to get you doing interesting and useful things from the beginning
- This is also *not* a full course on statistics or machine learning

---
# My Approach to Teaching

I think students learn the best when they're actually looking and thinking about data.

This means we will be looking at lots of data.

---
# Social Learning Works

I also think that we learn best when we are discussing data together.

# This is a Safe Space to Ask Questions

---
# Code of Conduct

This class is governed by the [BioData Club Code of Conduct](https://biodata-club.github.io/code_of_conduct/).

This class is meant to be a psychologically safe space where it's ok to ask questions.

I want to normalize your own curiosity and fuel your desire to learn more.

If you are disruptive to class learning or disparaging to other students, I may mute you for the day.

# Code of Conduct Violations

Please report them here:

# Class Discord

- [Slack 101 Videos](https://slack.com/resources/slack-101)

When is good link: 

Highlight all times that work for you.

---
# Class Assignments

Class Assignments will be done in RStudio Notebooks

Assignments will be submitted through Sakai. 

We will do our best to return it to you within a week.

We will highlight any points of confusion

---
# Why R?

R is an extremely powerful language for **statistical modeling**, machine learning, data manipulation, and visualization.

It's a *hub* language in that you can access many different kinds of systems (TensorFlow, Databases, Apache Spark) without needing to know other languages.

---
# R is Not Easy

- Learning R can be a difficult, but rewarding process
- Be patient with yourself, don't beat yourself up
- We'll try to make it a fun process for you
